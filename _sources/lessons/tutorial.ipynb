    "Introduction\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide was created for complete beginners (i.e. with no programming or\n",
    "computer science experience) and will teach you programming fundamentals in a\n",
    "language called [Python][]. Following a project-driven learning philosophy you\n",
    "will learn as you build your own project. There will be GIFs and screenshots\n",
    "throughout this guide to make everything as clear as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you complete this guide you'll be creating a virtual pet we'll call \"Pypet\"\n",
    "(a \"Python-pet\"). Remember [tamagochis][]? (Or if you were born in the 90s then\n",
    "think POKEMON!) With each new Python programming concepts you learn, you will\n",
    "add new features to your \"Pypet\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no software or computer requirements for this guide except that you\n",
    "need access to a web browser (which you obviously already have at this point).\n",
    "You will learn how to use a free tool called [Repl.it][replit] to set up your\n",
    "developer environment which takes away the typical pain of setting up a coding\n",
    "environment. It is also cloud based so you can log in from any computer to view\n",
    "your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a [scripting programming language][] known for both its\n",
    "simplicity and wide breadth of applications. For this reason it is considered\n",
    "one of the best languages for beginners. Used for everything from Web\n",
    "Development to Scientific Computing (and SO much more), Python is referred to\n",
    "as a \"general purpose\" language by the greater programming community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many Python programmers (aka \"Pythonistas\") love this language because it\n",
    "maintains a certain philosophy of best practices, described in Tim Peter’s\n",
    "famous [\"Zen of Python\"][]. There is a large Python community both off and\n",
    "online that is welcoming and supportive of beginners, and you can find a\n",
    "plethora of additional materials in the resources section of this guide.\n",

    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{attention}\n",
    "\n",
    "The instructions and screenshots in this section are for a service that seems\n",
    "to no longer be active, Nitrous.io. We will be using [Repl.it][replit] instead,\n",
    "but you'll have to muddle through the best you can until I get around to\n",
    "updating it.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started we'll need a \"development environment\", aka *a place to write\n",
    "and execute code*. For this we'll use [Repl.it][replit], a\n",
    "fast and free way to get you up and running. Repl.it is a cloud-based developer\n",
    "environment that works well for programming in python. Since Repl.it is a\n",
    "web application it won't matter whether you have a Mac or Windows or even Linux\n",
    "computer to run and test your code. Follow the instructions below to set up\n",
    "your Repl.it Development Environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to [Repl.it][replit] and create an account. *NOTE: You will have to check your\n",
    "   email and activate your account before you can sign in.*\n",
    "2. Once you have confirmed your email and signed in, click the \"open dashboard\"\n",
    "   button on their [homepage][replit]. You should be prompted to create your\n",
    "   first project aka developer environment.\n",
    "3. First choose \"Python\" as your template. Next you can rename your box to\n",
    "   anything you like or just leave it as is. Finally, don't worry about the\n",
    "   optional section that says \"Download a GitHub repo\". Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t![](http://i.imgur.com/gBTqt8X.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Click \"Create Box\" and then click \"Next\" until you see your box. Click on\n",
    "   your box and then launch your environment by clicking the orange IDE button\n",

    "    - In the **left panel**, you’ll see the File Browser. Here you can navigate\n",
    "      the files in your home folder. At this point, you will just have the\n",
    "      \"workspace\" folder and a README file introducing you to Repl.it When you\n",
    "      have more files, you can open them in Repl.it’s text editor by double\n",
    "      clicking on them in the File Browser.\n",
    "    - The **middle panel** is the Text Editor. This is where you can write and\n",
    "      edit code.\n",
    "    - The **right panel** is for chatting if you’re using Repl.it in\n",
    "      collaborative mode. Close this window for now by clicking the X in the\n",

    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we're going to learn how to store some different kinds of basic\n",
    "information in [variables][].\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are a way of storing information in Python. Below we\"ll create\n",
    "different variables for our Pypet such as name, weight, etc. Below is a GIF\n",
    "that shows how you will create variables for your Pypet in this section. You\n",
    "can refer back to this as you follow along with the instructions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://i.imgur.com/6o6eiaA.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a variable called `name` equal to `\"Fluffy\"` (or `\"Spike\"` or\n",
    "   `\"Sir Patrick\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   name = \"Fluffy\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Using an equals sign (`=`) sets a variable to a given value such as\n",
    "   `name = \"Fluffy\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Variables can store different types of data. In this case, `name` is\n",
    "   something called a **string** because `\"Fluffy\"` has quotations around it. A\n",
    "   **string** is just a set of characters surrounded by quotations (for example\n",
    "   `\"Bob\"`, `\"New York\"` or `\"h4ck3r\"`). *NOTE: Strings can use either single or\n",
    "   double quotes in Python.* A string can also include numbers, so long as it\"s\n",
    "   in between quotes. **Integers** on the other hand do not have quotations.\n",
    "   Let’s look at some additional data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create three additional variables to track `age`, `weight` and `hungry`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   name = \"Fluffy\"\n",
    "   age = 5\n",
    "   weight = 9.5\n",
    "   hungry = False\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `age` variable is an **integer** and therefore must be a whole number.\n",
    "   The `weight` variable is a **float**. Floats are a numbers that can have\n",
    "   values after the decimal point.  The `hungry` variable is a a **Boolean**.\n",
    "   Booleans store a value of either `True` or `False`. *NOTE: Don\"t use\n",
    "   quotations for these three data types, otherwise they\"d all be considered\n",
    "   strings*\n",

    "-------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a way to tell Python that all of these variables represent one cat (or\n",

    "   Here we’ve created a dictionary called `cat`. Each line contains a different\n",

    "   `\"age\"` etc) as well as a *value* (ex. `\"Fluffy\"`, `True`, `9.6` etc).\n",
    "   Unlike assigning variables, which use an equals sign (`name = \"Fluffy\"`),\n",

    "Part 4: Feeding your Pypet\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\"s \"feed\" our pypet using a Python function. A [function][] is a block of\n",
    "organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single action. First, we\n",
    "must define our function — `feed` — which changes our pypet’s `hungry`\n",
    "attribute to `False` to show that it is no longer hungry.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://i.imgur.com/dmjTM4H.gif)\n",

    "   `pet[\"hungry\"] = False`. *NOTE: In python the contents of a function must be\n",
    "   indented.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add `feed(cat)` below your function to use the `feed` function on your\n",

    "   By calling `feed(cat)` we are passing the variable `cat` into the function\n",
    "   in place of `pet`. `pet` acts as a placeholder for whatever variable we\n",
    "   decide to pass into the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   We should also increase the Pypet’s weight a bit since it has eaten.\n",

    "      cat[\"weight\"] = cat[\"weight\"] + 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Use this notation to increase floats and integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Try setting your original Pypet’s hungry variable to `True` and include a\n",
    "  `print(cat)` statement after `feed(cat)` to see if your Pypet\"s `hungry`\n",
    "  variable changed to `False` and their `weight` variable incrased.\n",
