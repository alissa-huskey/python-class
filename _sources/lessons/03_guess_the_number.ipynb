    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you’re going to make a Guess the Number game. The computer\n",
    "will think of a secret number from `1` to `20` and ask the user to guess it.\n",
    "After each guess, the computer will tell the user whether the number is too\n",
    "high or too low. The user wins if they can guess the number within six tries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good game to code because it covers many programming concepts in\n",
    "a short program. You’ll learn how to convert values to different data\n",
    "types and when you would need to do this. Since this program is a game,\n",
    "from now on we’ll call the user the player.\n",

    "Part 1. Setup\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new file called `guess.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Repl.it\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on creating and running new scripts on Repl.it see\n",
    "[Repl.it Tips](../tools/replit.html#running-new-scripts).\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by adding a docstring, surrounded by three double or single quotes, to\n",
    "the first line of your file with a brief description of this script.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} python\n",

    "\"\"\"This is a Guess the Number game.\"\"\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Even though the script doesn't do anything yet, go ahead and run it to make\n",
    "sure there are no errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2. Use the `random` Module\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides some functions that are built into the language like the\n",
    "`print()` function that you are already familiar with. There are even more\n",
    "functions available through {term}`modules`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A {term}`module` is a kind of reusable code that can be loaded into your\n",
    "scripts using the `import` keyword followed by the name of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collection of modules provided by Python is called the standard library,\n",
    "and that's what we'll be using today.  We are going to use the `random` module\n",
    "in this script. It has a function `randint()` which we will use to get a random\n",
    "number.\n",
    "\n",
    "To call a function that is part of a module, put the module\n",
    "{term}`namespace` in front of the function followed by a dot, then the\n",
    "function name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `randint()` function takes two arguments. The first is the minimum\n",
    "number, the second is the maximum number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try it in the Python Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "The {term}`Python shell` is an easy way to execute Python code interactively.\n",
    "You can think of it kind of like a whiteboard for code. It lets you quickly try\n",
    "small code snippets to see how they work. (See also [](../tools/python-shell.md).)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the command line, start a Python shell by typing `python`. The prompt will\n",
    "change to `>>>`.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Edit `guess.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand how importing works, import the module, then save\n",
    "a random number to the `number` variable by calling `random.randint()`.\n",

    "Part 3: Welcome the Player\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We've used the `input()` function before to get feedback from the user. It\n",
    "can take an optional {term}`argument`, a string that will be presented to\n",
    "the user as a prompt just to the left of their cursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use this new way of calling `input()` to get the players name and\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 4: Let the Player Guess\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We've used a `for` loop before to loop over items in a list. Here we will\n",
    "use the `range()` function, which allows us to easily repeat the loop\n",
    "a specific number of times. We will give it two arguments: the starting\n",
    "number and the `max_guesses` that we defined earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've also the `print()` function before but in the past we've always\n",
    "passed it only one argument. It can take as many arguments as you want and\n",
    "it will convert them each to strings and then print them with spaces\n",
    "in-between. Let's use this handy way to print the guess number each round.\n",

    "Part 5: Check the Guess\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The value in the `guess` variable is a string, because `input()` always\n",
    "returns a string. But we need a number variable to check the guess. To\n",
    "convert a string to an integer, we will use the `int()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once it is converted, we can use an {term}`if statement` to check it. We'll\n",

    "- Make two lists of strings called `winner_messages` and `loser_messages`.\n",
    "  Randomly choose an item from the appropriate list and print it at the\n",
    "  end of the game. Hint: You can use the `len()` function to find the\n",
    "  length of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ask the user if they want to play on easy, normal or hard mode when they\n",
    "  start, then change the number of guesses or the range of possible\n",
    "  numbers based on their answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep track of how far away each guess is from the right number. If they\n",
    "  get further away, print out an extra message to let them know.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't end after the player wins or loses, but instead offer them the\n",
    "  chance to play again. Keep track of their wins, losses and total number\n",
    "  of games played and print it at the end of each round.\n",
