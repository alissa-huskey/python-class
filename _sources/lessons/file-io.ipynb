    "Reading Files\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes in our programs we need to access information that is stored in a\n",
    "file. In programming this is called reading a file and that's what we'll learn\n",
    "first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading whole files\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will get the contents of a file containing a grocery list\n",
    "then then print it to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 1: Create `groceries.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll need a file to read from. Paste the following lines into a new file\n",
    "{file}`groceries.txt`, located in the same directory you will be running the\n",
    "script from, or the {term}`working directory`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} text\n",
    ":caption: groceries.txt\n",
    ":linenos:\n",
    "- eggs\n",
    "- milk\n",
    "- flour\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 2: Print grocery list\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Create a second file {file}`groceries.py` also in the working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. To interact with files we start by using Pythons built-in `open()` function.\n",
    "It returns a {term}`file handler` object, which we'll assign to a variable\n",
    "`fh`. The `open()` function takes at least one argument, the location of the\n",
    "file to open. In this case we want a string with the filename:\n",
    "{file}`\"groceries.txt\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. The {term}`file handler` object represents the connection to the file and\n",
    "provides methods for interacting with the file.  In this case, we are\n",
    "interested in the `.read()` method which returns the entire contents of the\n",
    "file as a string. We'll assign the string to the variable `contents`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. We're done with the file now so we'll call the `.close()` method on `fh` to\n",
    "free up the computer resources used to manage the file. It is important to\n",
    "always close a file handler when its no longer needed to avoid bugs that may\n",
    "slow down your computer or interfere with the file you opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. Finally, we'll print the title `\"Groceries\"` underlined with `=` followed by the\n",
    "contents of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} python\n",
    ":caption: groceries.py\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Copy the following text and paste it into a file named {file}`mug-brownie.md` in your working directory.\n",
    "   ```{literalinclude} mug-brownie.md\n",
    "   :language: md\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Create a new file {file}`recipe.py` for this exercise.\n",
    "3. Use the `open()` function to get a file handler for the {file}`mug-brownie.md` file.\n",
    "4. Use the `.read()` method to get the contents of the file and assign it to a variable `recipe`.\n",
    "5. Use the `.close()` method to close the file handler.\n",
    "6. Print the `recipe`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`````\n",
    "\n",
    "`````{solution} reading-files-exercise\n",

    "recipe = fh.read()\n",
    "fh.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(recipe)\n",
    "```\n",
    "`````\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading lines\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes instead of getting the entire contents of a file at once, we want to\n",
    "go through each line line for more fine grained control.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the `.readlines()` method on file handler objects comes in. It\n",
    "returns a list, where each element is one line from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 1: Use `.readlines()`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we'll modify the `recipes.py` file to use the `.readlines()`\n",
    "method in a `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Since we'll be printing each line as it is read, first we'll need to move the\n",
    "header lines to the beginning of the script so that they are printed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. As before, we'll need a file handler object from `open()`, so we can leave that\n",
    "line unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. This time we'll replace the `.read()` line with a `for` loop, iterating over the\n",
    "list returned by `fh.readlines()`. We'll call the item variable `line`, since\n",
    "it will contain a line from the file in each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. Now the list returned by `.readlines()` retains the carriage return (`\"\\n\"`) at\n",
    "the end of each `line` string. So when we print each `line` in the for loop,\n",
    "we'll tell the `print()` function not to add a newline by passing it the `end`\n",
    "keyword argument with a value of `\"\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. Finally, we'll still want to `.close()` the file handler, so that line can stay\n",
    "the way it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} python\n",
    ":caption: groceries.py\n",
    ":emphasize-lines: \"8-14\"\n",
    ":linenos:\n",
    "# print a header\n",

    "# loop through each line of the file\n",
    "for line in fh.readlines():\n",
    "\n",
    "  # print the line which includes the trailing \"\\n\"\n",

    "  # so it doesn't add an extra newline\n",

    "\n",
    "# close the file handler\n",
    "fh.close()\n",

    "Writing Files\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we need to create or modify files. That's what we'll be learning in\n",
    "this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating or trucating\n",
    "\n",
    "The `open()` function takes an optional `mode` argument, which is a string that\n",
    "indicates what we plan to do with the file. The default is `\"r\"` for read mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "To write to a file though, we'll open it in write mode by passing the optional\n",
    "mode argument `\"w\"` to `open()`. Write mode will either create or overwrite the\n",
    "file and open it with permission to write.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 1: Write to `packing.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we're going write the contents of a `to_pack` list to a\n",
    "{file}`packing.txt` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Create a file {file}`packing.py`, add a `create_packing()` function and\n",
    "call it. The rest of your code in this section will go in this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Add a `to_pack` list of strings, things to pack.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. Get a file handler `fh` by calling `open()` with the arguments `\"packing.txt\"`\n",
    "and `\"w\"` for write mode. Be aware: the file is created or\n",
    "{term}`truncated <truncate>` as soon as `open()` is called when in write mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. Using a `for` loop iterate over the `to_pack` list and name the item variable\n",
    "`thing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. In write mode, file handler objects keep a {term}`buffer` where the text to be\n",
    "written to the file is stored until `.close()` is called. Inside the loop we'll\n",
    "add each `thing` to the buffer by calling the `.write()` method on `fh` with\n",
    "the argument {samp}`\"- {thing}\\n\"`. Don't forget to add a `\"\\n\"` to the end\n",
    "of each string or the file will all be smooshed onto one long line!\n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. As always, we need to `.close()` the file handler when we're done with the\n",
    "file. It is especially important in write mode because that is when the buffer\n",
    "is written to disk.\n",
    "\n",

    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of reasons that it is important to always `.close()` a file\n",
    "handler object when you're done with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In theory Python is supposed to close any open file handlers when a program\n",
    "  ends, but it's not a guarentee.\n",
    "- The more files are open, the more resources are used, and the more space is\n",
    "  taken up in memory. Leaving things open unneccassarily could slow down your\n",
    "  program and your computer while your program runs.\n",
    "- File changes usually don't go into effect until you close the file handler.\n",
    "  If another part of your program is counting on those changes, you'll run into\n",
    "  unpleasant surprises if you haven't yet closed it.\n",
    "- There are limits to how many files a computer can have open at a time. While\n",
    "  it is rare to bump up against those limits in normal operation, it's\n",
    "  certainly the kind of trouble a programmer can get themselves into by\n",
    "  mistake. (Imagine opening files in an infinate loop!)\n",
    "- Some operating sytems treat open files as locked, which may prevent you from\n",
    "  reading the file with another program or even deleting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes mistakes happen. It's easy to forget, and what if there is an\n",
    "error after opening the file but before it is closed?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where the `with` statement and {term}`context managers <context manager>`\n",
    "come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: the `with` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "File handlers in Python have the feature of being {term}`context managers`,\n",
    "which are objects designed to know how to do their own housekeeping for use in\n",
    "a `with` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "More on that later, but first lets take a quick look at the syntax of a `with`\n",
    "statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "{{ leftcol | replace(\"col\", \"col-5\") }}\n",
    "\n",
    "```{include} ../templates/syntax/with.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For files it looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(...) as fh:\n",
    "    # do stuff with fh\n",
    "```\n",

    "```{include} ../templates/desc/with.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "{{ endcols }}\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what does that do?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement wraps a block of code with calls to internal setup and\n",
    "teardown methods provided by the context manager. In particular, anything that\n",
    "ends the execution of the block triggers a call to the teardown method; whether\n",
    "it ended because it finished or because there was an error. Neither errors nor\n",
    "{kbd}`^C` stays the `with` statement from completing the appointed teardown.\n",
    "\n",
    "% The `with` statement wraps a block of code and ensures that internal setup and\n",
    "% teardown methods provided by the context manager are called before the code is\n",
    "% executed, and when it ends respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "File handlers know how to clean up after themselves. That means that when used\n",
    "in a `with` statement `.close()` is called automatically at the end of the\n",
    "statement, even if there is an error in the {samp}`{BODY}`.\n",
    "\n",
