    "\n",
    "A {term}`statement` is an instruction that Python can run or {term}`execute` as\n",
    "a unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like grammar in prose, statements follow syntax rules telling Python where they\n",
    "begin and end as well as how they should be handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's syntax rules define statements as either a single logical line of\n",
    "code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "debug_mode = True\n",

    "Simple Statements\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "A {term}`simple statement` is a single instruction, one that does not group together\n",
    "other statements. In comparison to prose a simple statement is like a sentence.\n",
    "While there are exceptions, a simple statements is essentially a line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more accurate, a simple statement is a single instruction that *could* be\n",
    "written on one line by itself, even if it is actually written differently.\n",
    "This is referred to as a {term}`logical line`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single line statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time simple statements are written one per line. The newline\n",

    "Compound Statements\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "A {term}`compound statement` is a a number of statements grouped together as a\n",
    "single unit.  If a simple statement like a sentence, a compound statement is\n",

    "the group of statements, called a {term}`suite`, that belong to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A header statement always starts with a a keyword (like `def` or `if`) and ends\n",
    "in a `:`. This header tells Python that a compound statement has started, that\n",
    "it is in charge of all of the indented lines to follow, and how and when they\n",
    "should be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The header line and the suite of statements that belong to it are called a\n",
    "{term}`clause`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-clause statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Some compound statements can have more than one clause. This allows a different\n",
    "set of statements to be triggered depending on the circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of an if-statement with three clauses.\n",

    "The difference can be confusing, especially since in Python there is a fair bit\n",
    "of overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think of it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * if you can save the the result of the code to a variable, then it is an expression\n",
    "  * if the result of the code causes something to happen it is a statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The string `\"hello\"` on a line by itself is does not cause anything to\n",
    "happen, therefore it is not a statement. Whereas `message = \"hello\"` causes the\n",
    "variable `message` to be assigned the value `\"hello\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function call may or may not be an expression. But a function call on a line\n",
