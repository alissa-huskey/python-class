    "Loops\n",
    "=====\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally Python reads one statement at a time, one at a time. But loops give us\n",
    "the ability to repeat a set of statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "While loops\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "A {term}`while loop` is a {term}`compound statement`. Like an {term}`if statement`\n",
    "while loops include a conditional expression and a {term}`suite` of\n",
    "statements that will be repeated until the expression evaluates to false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time that the suite of statements is repeated in a loop it is called an\n",
    "{term}`iteration`. Likewise, the process of repeating a loop is called\n",
    "{term}`iterating`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example that will keep asking the user for their name until\n",
    "they answer.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```{exercise}\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a while loop that asks the user `\"Heads or tails?\"` until they answer\n",
    "with either `\"heads\"` or `\"tails\"`. *Hint: Use the `not in` operator.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a while loop that prints a random number between `1` and `100` until\n",
    "   the answer is greater than `50`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Infinite loops\n",
    "\n",
    "When a program is written in such a way that the loop condition is always met\n",
    "the result is called an {term}`infinite loop`. These are easy to cause by\n",
    "mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple examples:\n",

    "### Quitting a loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `break` statement can be used to stop loop iteration.\n",

    "You can skip the rest of the statements in a loop iteration by using the\n",

    "Loop patterns\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we're going to go over some of the ways that loops are commonly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Incrementing\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in programming we want to repeat a suite of statements a specific number\n",
    "of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do this is to keep track of which iteration the loop is currently\n",
    "executing by incrementing (or decrementing) a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} python\n",
    "---\n",
    "caption: incrementing the `i` variable\n",
    "linenos:\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while i < 10:\n",
    "  print(\"Iteration:\", i+1)\n",
    "  i = i + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{exercise}\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a loop that counts down from `3` to `1`. In each iteration print out the\n",
    "current number then use the `time.sleep` function to pause for one second.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterating over a list\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a `while` loop to iterate over the items in a list. To do this\n",
    "we'll increment an `i` variable just like we did above but we'll use the\n",
    "`len()` function to determine the length of the list and therfore how many\n",
    "times the loop should repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can use the `i` variable to access each item in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} python\n",
    "---\n",
    "caption: iterating over a list\n",
    "linenos:\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "colors = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "while i < len(colors):\n",
    "  color = colors[i]\n",
    "  print(\"Color\", i, \"is:\", colors[i])\n",
    "  i += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{exercise}\n",
    "\n",
    "Print a lunch menu. Make a list of lunch `choices` on a menu. Use a while loop\n",
    "to print out each item in the list with the number next to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use this to iterate over list-like values. For example, a string\n",
    "can be used like a list of characters. So we can use the same pattern to\n",
    "iterate over all of the characters in a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} python\n",
    "---\n",
    "caption: iterating over the characters in a string\n",
    "linenos:\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "word = input(\"Enter a word: \")\n",
    "\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while i < len(word):\n",
    "    print(\"Letter\", i, \"is:\", word[i])\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{exercise}\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the vowels in a word. Ask the user for a word then iterate over each\n",
    "letter. If the letter is not a vowel, (*hint: make a list of vowels the use\n",
    "`not in`*) use a `continue` statement to skip the rest of the iteration. Then\n",
    "print the character number and the character.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like you can have an if statement inside of another if statement, you can\n",
    "also have a while loop inside of another while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example prints out a score card for three rounds of three players each."
