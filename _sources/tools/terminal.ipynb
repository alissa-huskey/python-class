    "* **Prompt symbol** -- a symbol that indicates the end of the prompt. `bash`\n",
    "  uses `$`, `zsh` uses `%` and `PowerShell` uses `>`.\n",
    "* **Cursor** -- indicates the position where your text will go when you type.\n",
    "    (This may vary depending on the system.) On most systems the cursor will\n",

    "### 2.1: Commands and arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Every command that you run on the terminal is really just a program. For\n",

    "$ uname\n",
    "Darwin\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `echo` command is very similar to the Python `print()` command--it prints\n",
    "any arguments that follow to the screen, followed by a newline.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the command line, arguments are seperated by spaces and quotes are usually\n",
    "not needed. In this example, we'll use the `echo` command with one argument:\n",
    "`Hello.`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} console\n",

    ":class: full-width\n",

    "filename that includes spaces. (Which is one of the reasons that's not\n",
    "recommended.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we have a file named `hello world.py`. If we try to run the file the\n",
    "normal way, `python` will get two arguments: `hello` and `world.py`. Python\n",
    "will look for a file `hello` first, and exit with an error message when it is\n",

    "Many programs take {term}`flags <flag>` or {term}`options <option>`, which are\n",
    "special arguments that start with a dash (`-`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Short options start with a single dash followed by a single character. For\n",
    "example, the `date` command takes a `-u` flag which tells `date` to use UTC\n",

    "Long options start with two dashes followed by a human readable word. For\n",

    ":caption: command line\n",
    "$ python --version\n",
    "Python 3.8.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes an option requires an argument. For example the `python` command\n",
    "accepts the `-c` option to specify a Python statement to execute. Notice that\n",
    "since the command contains both spaces and double quotes, it is enclosed in\n",
    "single quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} console\n",
    ":caption: command line\n",
    "$ python -c 'print(\"oh hai\")'\n",
    "oh hai\n",
    "```\n",

    "Sometimes there is both a long and short version of the same option. For\n",
    "example, to print the usage for `python` you can use either `-h` or `--help`.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Commands on the command line are programs.\n",

    "  only needed to enclose arguments with spaces or other special characters.\n",
    "* {term}`flags <flag>` or {term}`options <option>` are special arguments that\n",
    "  start with a dash (`-`).\n",
    "* Short options start with a single dash followed by a single character like:\n",

    "  short for `-x -y -z`.\n",
    "* Long options start with two dashes followed by a human readable word like:\n",
    "  `--long`.\n",
    "* The commands:\n",
    "  * `echo` -- print to screen\n",
    "  * `date` -- show date and time\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.3: Getting Help\n",
    "\n",
    "Many programs, including `python`, take a `-h` or `--help` option which will\n",
    "show usage information about that particular program, usually including the\n",
