    "\n",
    "The process of transforming a concept into code is the art of problem solving\n",
    "and it starts before you write a single line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is writing out instructions for the computer. So in order for our\n",
    "programs to work as expected, we must first know ourselves what it is that we\n",
    "are want the computer to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",

    "Problem solving process\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will provide one approach to problem solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Define the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to make sure you understand the problem you are trying to\n",
    "solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a short description of the problem you are trying to solve.  This will\n",
    "often end up being the docstring for your script or function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your description should answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Who will use this?\n",
    "- Why do they need it?\n",
    "- What does it do?\n",
    "- What are the inputs?\n",
    "- What are the outputs?\n",
    "- What are the side effects?\n",
    "- What is an example of when this might be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple of examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} python\n",
    ":caption: docstring for a hangman script\n",
    "\"\"\"Hangman game\n",
    "\n",
    "A single-user game where the player is given 6 chances to guess all of the letters in a word.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} python\n",
    ":caption: is_prime() function with docstring including description and examples\n",
    "def is_prime(number):\n",
    "  \"\"\"Return True if the number is a prime. Takes a positive whole number and returns True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Examples\n",
    "  --------\n",
    "  >>> is_prime(3)\n",
    "  True\n",
    "\n",
    "  >>> is_prime(4)\n",
    "  False\n",
    "  \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Make a plan\n",
    "\n",
    "![South Park Underpants Gnomes](assets/underpants.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the part where you figure out how to solve the problem. You're not\n",
    "writing code yet, but rather thinking it through.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep the plan as simple as possible while still covering all the steps. You\n",
    "can drill down into each part as you go.  It is sometimes helpful to using a\n",
    "pen and paper or whiteboard to sketch out a visual representation of the\n",
    "problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For larger problems, you'll want to start by breaking it down into logical\n",
    "parts. Think in terms of how it will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} text\n",
    ":caption: docstring for the hangman script, now including the plan\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Hangman game\n",
    "\n",
    "A single-user game where the player is given 6 chances to guess all of the letters in a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. choose a short word, give the player 6 chances to guess letters\n",
    "2. each turn:\n",
    "    - print their chances with `x` to show used chances, and `_` to show remaining\n",
    "      example: `chances: xx____`\n",
    "    - print the word, but replace `_` for unguessed letters\n",
    "      example: `5 letters: _e___`\n",
    "    - ask the player to guess a letter\n",
    "3. tell the user at the end if they won or lost\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For more tightly scoped problems, solve the problem manually then describe each\n",
    "step in plain english.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} python\n",
    ":caption: updated is_prime() function, now including the plan in comments\n",
    "def is_prime(number):\n",
    "  \"\"\"Return True if the number is a prime. Takes a positive whole number and returns True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Examples\n",
    "  --------\n",
    "  >>> is_prime(3)\n",
    "  True\n",
    "\n",
    "  >>> is_prime(4)\n",
    "  False\n",
    "  \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  # iterate through each number less than the input number, starting at 2\n",
    "  # for each:\n",
    "      # divide the numbers\n",
    "  #    - if the number is whole, return False\n",
    "  # if all numbers have been iterated through without returning, return True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Implement\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick a part of your plan to start at. (Sometimes it makes more sense to start\n",
    "at the middle.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Simplify\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask yourself if this needs to be broken down further. If so, start back at at\n",
    "the first step for this new problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've got the problem broken down into a discreet chunk, simplify it if\n",
    "neccessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Isolate it from other code by using use hardcoded placeholders. This can be\n",
    "  especially helpful when other parts of the program aren't written yet, if\n",
    "  you're not certian they are working, or if the data can be unpredictable.\n",
    "- Solve the easiest or most normal case first.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Write pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a plain english description of what the code should do. This can be a\n",
    "list of steps in comments. For simpler problems this may be the same as your\n",
    "plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Write the code\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill in the actual code under the pseudocode comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### D. Verify\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure the code works as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few different ways to check the output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- run your program with extra print statements\n",
    "- paste the code into a shell\n",
    "- write and run a test\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where it is especially important to make sure your code is isolated. If\n",
    "you have too much going on, it will be hard to figure out which part isn't working.\n",
    "\n",
