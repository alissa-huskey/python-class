    "\n",
    "Text adventure games, sometimes called interactive fiction, are an old genre\n",
    "where the entire world is described with text. The gameplay is done through\n",
    "simple commands like `go north` or `eat pie`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each area in the game, item, or action has its own description.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find a [demo][game-demo] of a game like this on Replit, and the\n",

    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we'll be writing the game loop--the main interface that allows\n",
    "the user to enter commads, do something, print messages to the user, and\n",
    "continue with the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll write a `main()` function to be the core of this interface. In it we'll\n",
    "use an infinite `while` loop to run the game. Every time the loop runs it will\n",
    "ask the user for input, then do something based on their response.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will eventually write a function to coorespond to each of the commands\n",
    "available in the game, which will be called from `main()` when the user enters\n",
    "the relevant command.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now though, we're just setting up the basic framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1.1: Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new file called `adventure.py`. (You might consider creating a new\n",
    "repo for it, if you're comfortable with git.)\n",
    "2. Give the file a docstring that includes the link to this page.\n",
