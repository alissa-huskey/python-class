    "Text adventure games, sometimes called interactive fiction, are an old genre\n",
    "where the entire world is described with text. The gameplay is done through\n",

    "\n",
    "Each area in the game, item, or action has its own description.\n",

    "\n",
    "We'll write a `main()` function to be the core of this interface. In it we'll\n",
    "use an infinite `while` loop to run the game. Every time the loop runs it will\n",
    "ask the user for input, then do something based on their response.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will eventually write a function to coorespond to each of the commands\n",
    "available in the game, which will be called from `main()` when the user enters\n",
