Adventure Game
==============

Text adventure games, sometimes called interactive fiction, are an old genre
where the entire world is described with text. The gameplay is done through
simple commands like `go north` or `eat pie`.

Each area in the game, item, or action has its own description.

You can find a [demo][game-demo] of a game like this on Replit, and the
[source code][game-code] is on github. (Though the version we'll be writing is
much simpler to start.).
