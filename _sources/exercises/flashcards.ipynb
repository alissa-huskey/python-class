    "==================\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the project to apply what we've learned in the [](../lessons/files) lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is to write a program for running through flashcards. Card data is\n",
    "stored in `csv` files in the `data/flashcards` directory.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Make a `csv` file\n",
    "\n",
    "The flashcards data will be stored in `csv` files in a directory named\n",
    "`data/flashcards`. The idea is to eventually have multiple files for different\n",
    "topics that you might want to study like `paths.csv`, `functions.csv` and so\n",
    "on. For now though, just make one file.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` Create a folder `data/flashcards` if it doesn't already exist\n",
    "2. `[ ]` Make a `csv` file with flashcard data\n",
    "   * `[ ]` In the `data/flashcards` directory manually make file ending in\n",
    "         `.csv`. For example `paths.csv`.\n",
    "   * `[ ]` Each line should be one card with the format: {samp}`{text for front}, {text for back}`. \\\n",
    "        For example:\n",
    "        ```text\n",
    "        front, back\n",
    "        import the Path class, from pathlib import Path\n",
    "        check if Path object path exists, path.exists()\n",
    "        check if Path object path is a file, path.is_file()\n",
    "        check if Path object path is a directory, path.is_dir()\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Start `flashcards.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Start your {file}`flashcards.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` write a `main()` function\n",
    "1. `[ ]` print any temporary debug message in it\n",
    "1. `[ ]` call it\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3: Start `load_csv()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `load_csv()` function should take one argument, a `Path` object to a csv\n",
    "file. Eventually it will return a `list` where each item is a `dict` with `\"front\"`\n",
    "and `\"back\"` keys, one for each row in the file except the header.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now though, make a simple function that just takes a `Path` object, prints\n",
    "the location, and makes sure the file exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} load_csv()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` write a `load_csv()` function that takes one argument: `path`\n",
    "1. `[ ]` check to make sure the `csv` file exists. If not, print an error message\n",
    "       that includes the path then return\n",
    "1. `[ ]` print a temporary debug message: {samp}`loading file: {path}`\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` make a `Path` object to your `csv` file\n",
    "1. `[ ]` call your `load_csv()` function, passing it your `Path` object as the\n",
    "      argument, and assign the returned value to a variable named `cards`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 4: Read each line of the csv file\n",
    "\n",
    "Expand the `load_csv()` function to read and print every line in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in load_csv()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` open the csv file in read mode using the `open()` function\n",
    "1. `[ ]` use `fh.readlines()` to iterate through each line in the file\n",
    "1. `[ ]` for temporary debugging, print each line\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 5: Get the card data from the csv file\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue expanding the `load_csv()` function to extract the card data from each\n",
    "line, put it into a dictionary named `cards` with the keys `\"front\"` and\n",
    "`\"back\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in load_csv(), **in** the readlines() loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` make an empty `dict` assigned to a variable named `card`\n",
    "1. `[ ]` split each line on the `\",\"` using the `.split()` method and assign\n",
    "       the result to a variable named `row`\n",
    "1. `[ ]` check that there are two items in the row using the `len()` function.\n",
    "       If not print an error message and return\n",
    "1. `[ ]` assign `card[\"front\"]` to the first item in the row, and `card[\"back\"]` to\n",
    "       the second\n",
    "1. `[ ]` for temporary debugging, print the `card` `dict`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 6: Return the card data to `main()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Have `load_csv()` put all of the `card` dictionaries into one big `cards`\n",
    "`list` and return that to `main()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in load_csv(), **before** the readlines() loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` make an empty `list` assigned to a variable named `cards`\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in load_csv(), **at the end** of the readlines() loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` use the `.append()` method on the `cards` `list` with the argument `card`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in load_csv(), **after** the loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` return `cards`\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` if the `cards` `list` is falsy, `return`\n",
    "1. `[ ]` otherwise, print the `cards` `list` for temporary debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 7: Remove extra whitespace\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make sure that the flashcards are printed nicely and that the users\n",
    "answers get matched up correctly, the trailing `\"\\n\"` needs to be removed from\n",
    "the end of each line. Any extra spaces that happen to be around the `\",\"` or at\n",
    "the beginning or end of the line also need to be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in load_csv(), **in** the loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` remove leading and trailing whitespace by calling the `.strip()` method\n",
    "       on `card[\"front\"]` and `card[\"back\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### part 8: Skip the header row and blank lines\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid having a flashcard pop up that reads `\"front\"`, don't append the\n",
    "header row to the `cards` `list`. Also skip any blank lines in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in load_csv(), **in** the readlines() loop, **before** append\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` check if `card[\"front\"]` is `\"front\"` and `card[\"back\"]` is `\"back\"`. If so,\n",
    "    `continue` to avoid appending to the cards list\n",
    "1. `[ ]` check if `line` is equal to `\"\\n\"`. If so, `continue`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 9: Start the `play()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "This function should take one argument, the list of cards.\n",
    "Eventually it will contain the user interface for running through each\n",
    "card, getting the answers from the user, and printing the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now 'll just write a `play()` function and call it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} play()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` write a `play() f`unction that takes one argument: `cards`\n",
    "1. `[ ]` for temporary debugging, print something from it\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` call `play()` passing it the list of `cards`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 10: Go through each card in random order\n",
    "\n",
    "In this next part we'll be metaphorically drawing a card at random from the\n",
    "deck until there are none left.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trick is to make a {term}`while loop` that checks the {term}`truthy` value\n",
    "of `cards`, so that it stops as soon as its empty. The inside the loop, use the\n",
    "`random.choice()` method to pick a `card` at random, then remove it from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} at the top of your file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` `import` the `random` module\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in play()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` make a while loop where the condition is: `cards`\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in play(), **in** the loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` use `random.choice()` to get a random item from the `cards`\n",
    "       list and assign it to a variable named `card`\n",
    "1. `[ ]` call the `.remove()` method on `cards` with the argument `card` to\n",
    "       remove the card from the list\n",
    "1. `[ ]` for temporary debugging, print `card`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 11: Test the user\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where things start to get exciting! In this part we'll print the front\n",
    "of the card, ask the user for their answer, and let them know if it was right\n",
    "or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in play(), **in** the loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` print `card[\"front\"]`\n",
    "1. `[ ]` prompt the user for their answer using the `input()` function and assign\n",
    "       the result to a variable named `answer`\n",
    "1. `[ ]` check if the `answer` is the same as `card[\"back\"]`\n",
    "   * `[ ]` if so, print `\"CORRECT\"`\n",
    "   * `[ ]` if not, print `\"INCORRECT\",` then `cards[\"back\"]`\n",
    "1. `[ ]` call `input()` asking if the user wants to continue\n",
    "   * `[ ]` if not, return\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in play(), **after** the loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 12: Scorekeeping\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets keep track of which card the user is on, and what their score is.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in play(), **above** the loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` make a `score` variable set to `0`\n",
    "1. `[ ]` assign the length of cards to a variable `total`\n",
    "1. `[ ]` make a `num` variable set to `1`\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in play(), **in** the loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` at the top of the loop print {samp}`card {num} of {total}`\n",
    "1. `[ ]` when you check if the `answer` is the same as `card[\"back\"]`\n",
    "   * `[ ]` if so, increment `score` by one\n",
    "1. `[ ]` at the end of the loop, increment `num` by `1`\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in play(), **after** the loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` print {samp}`\"{score} of {total}\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 13: Prettify flashcards\n",
    "\n",
    "This part is about making the the flashcards look nicer. Feel free to adjust\n",
    "these suggestions to your taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} throughout your file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` get rid of any debug `print()` statements\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} at the top of your file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` make a global variable `WIDTH` and set it to around `75`\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in play()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` print a line to the beginning and end of each card\n",
    "1. `[ ]` add some extra newlines around various elements\n",
    "1. `[ ]` center any string by calling the `.center()` method on it and\n",
    "       pass the argument `WIDTH`. For example, the `card[\"front\"]` line.\n",
    "1. `[ ]` right align any string by calling the .rjust() method on it and passing\n",
    "       the argument `WIDTH`. For example, the {samp}`card {x} of {y}` line.\n",
    "1. `[ ]` print {samp}`\"{score} of {total}\"` after the end of each card\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 14: Wrap long questions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part wrap questions that are too long so that they are split into multiple lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} at the top of your file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` If you want your questions to be wrap at a shorter length than `WIDTH`, set a `MAXWIDTH` global variable.\n",
    "1. `[ ]` `import` the `textwrap` module\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in play(), **in** the loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` Call `textwrap.wrap()` with the arguments `card[\"front\"]` and the width\n",
    "       you want to wrap at, either `MAXWIDTH` or `WIDTH`. This will return a\n",
    "       `list` of strings, where each item is a line. Assign the results to a\n",
    "       variable `lines`.\n",
    "1. `[ ]` Remove the code that prints `card[\"front\"]`\n",
    "1. `[ ]` Iterate over the `lines` list, and print each item.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 15: Add topics menu\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will add a menu to print the name (minus the `.csv` extension) of\n",
    "each of the csv files in your flashcards directory and allow the user to choose\n",
    "one or more files to load.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} at the top of your file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` Make a list assigned to the global variable `TOPICS`\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} menu()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` write a `menu()` function\n",
    "1. `[ ]` assign `TOPICS` to a list of `Path` objects in your flashcards directory using the `.iterdir()` method\n",
    "1. `[ ]` print an error message if no files are found in your flashcards directory\n",
    "1. `[ ]` print the filename minus the `.csv` extension for each `Path` object in the `TOPICS` list, next to a number\n",
    "1. `[ ]` print a special option `\"all\"` with a menu selection of `0`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` make a `list` assigned to the variable `selection`\n",
    "1. `[ ]` get input from the user asking them to choose one or more topics and assign it to a variable `choices`\n",
    "1. `[ ]` use the `.split()` method to split `choices` into multiple items on whitespace\n",
    "1. `[ ]` iterate over each response and assign to `num`:\n",
    "    * `[ ]` if the response is `\"0\"`, return `TOPICS`\n",
    "    * `[ ]` convert `num` to an int and subtract `1`\n",
    "    * `[ ]` get the item from `TOPICS` at the `num` index and append it to `selection` list\n",
    "1. `[ ]` return the `selection` list\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` at the beginning of the function, make an empty `cards` list\n",
    "1. `[ ]` call `menu()` and assign the returned value to the variable `paths`\n",
    "1. `[ ]` remove the line where you previously defined the path to your `.csv` file\n",
    "1. `[ ]` iterate over `paths` and assign each element to the variable `path`:\n",
    "    * `[ ]` call `load_csv()` with the `path` argument\n",
    "    * `[ ]` append the returned value to `cards` using the `.extend()` method\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 16: Allow answers with commas\n",
    "\n",
    "Many answers have commas in them, so instead of manually parsing the csv file,\n",
    "lets use the built in `csv` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create and iterate over a `csv.reader` object, which will provide each\n",
    "line split into a list of fields that we can use as the `row`. Then either\n",
    "remove all of the places where we use `line`, or replace them with an\n",
    "equivalent for `row`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} at the top of your file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` `import` the `csv` module\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in load_csv() after opening your file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` Create a new csv reader like so:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   reader = csv.reader(\n",
    "       fh,\n",
    "       quotechar=\"'\",\n",
    "       skipinitialspace=True,\n",
    "       escapechar=\"\\\\\"\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. `[ ]` Instead of iterating over `fh.readlines()`, iterate over the `reader`\n",
    "   object. Change the variable name in the for loop to `row`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{rubric} in load_csv(), in the for loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` Remove the `row = line.split()` line. (Since `row` is now a list\n",
    "   provided by the `reader` object.)\n",
    "2. `[ ]` Check if `row` is an empty list. If so, `continue`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 17: limit CLI argument\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we'll change the program to accept an optional command line\n",
    "argument to limit the number of cards to show.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if at the command line you type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ python flashcards.py 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then at most 10 flashcards will be shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or if you type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ python flashcards.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then then you'll go through all of the flashcards for the selected topic(s).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]` Check if `sys.argv` has more than `1` item. If so:\n",
    "   * `[ ]` assign the second value in the `sys.argv` list, converted to an\n",
    "          `int` to the variable `limit`\n",
