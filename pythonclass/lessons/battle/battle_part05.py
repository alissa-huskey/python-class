PyPet Battle Game:

[ ] Two fighters are randomly chosen from a list of PETS, each starting with a
    health of 100
[ ] Print out details about the chosen fighters
[ ] Each fighter takes a turn attacking the other until one fighter wins.
    - Each attack will have a description and do randomly selected amount of
      damage between 10-30
    - Each attack will print out the description of the attack, the damage it
      did, and the health of each fighter at the end of the turn
    - Whoever reaches 0 first loses and the other player wins.
[ ] At the end of the game, announce the winner
