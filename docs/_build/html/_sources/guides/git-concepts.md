Git Concepts
============

Locally Grown
-------------

Your set of files that you work on locally is sometimes called a **working
directory**, **working copy**, **working tree** or **local checkout**.

A **tree** is the directory structure and contents of your files, or a snapshot
of them from a particular point in time.


Anatomy of a Repository
-----------------------

We've already talked about how a repository is the version control data for
your codebase. Now we'll go into a little more detail about what kind of
information git stores and what that means for how to use it.

Every repository contains:

* **object database** -- the history of all commits and the relationships
  between them.

* one or more **branches** -- a branch is a container that has a name and
  stores set of commits. For now all you need to know is that every repository
  is created with a default branch named **master** that all of your commits
  are being stored on.

* **HEAD** -- a reference to the current commit on the current branch. A
  reference is like a bookmark to a commit. Since we're not doing anything
  fancy, `HEAD` will point to the most recent commit on the `master` branch for
  the forseeable future.

* the **tree** -- a snapshot of your files at the time of the `HEAD` commit.

* the **index** -- a snapshot of your files at the time of the `HEAD` commit
  plus the changes you've staged for commit.


Conceptually, your repository looks a little something like this:

```
                        +------------------------+     +----------------------+
                        |    object-db           |     |  index               |
                        |  +---------------------+     +----------------------+
   HEAD ---> master ----+->| c331b4d gitign...------------+----------------+  |

                        |  | ...               | |     |  +----------------+  |
                        |  +-------------------+ |     |                      |
                        +------------------------+     |  +----------------+  |
                                                       |  | staging        |  |
                                                       |  +----------------+  |
                                                       |  | +LICENCE.md    |  |
                                                       |  | +bin/          |  |
                                                       |  | ...            |  |
                                                       |  +----------------+  |
                                                       +----------------------+
```

Mo' repos, mo' versions
-----------------------

But wait, there's more!

There are actually at least two repositories of your files.

* The one on Repl.it. Even though it is not actually on your physical computer,
  it is where you're editing the files so we'll refer to it as a **local repository**.
* The **remote repository** on Github.
* Eventually you may also have an actually-local local repository on your
  computer.


### In Which I Digress

Git is a special kind of version control system called **Distributed version
control**. As opposed to **Centralized Version Control Systems** that have one
central repository that all other repositories were required to communicate
with in order to commit changes. In git on the other hand, every repo is self-
contained--that means anyone who has a local checkout of a repo can make
commits and look up changes to their hearts content without having to consult
any other repo.

Additionally, every repo can send changes to or receive changes from
any other compatable repo.

Imagine we all worked on the same codebase. The difference between the two
systems would be somthing like this:

```
                                      |
     Centeralized Version Control     |  Decentralized Version Control
                                      |
                                      |             Jayson
            Central Repo              |           /   |   \
            ------------              |          /    |    \
             /  |   \                 |      Alissa---+---Github
            /   |    \                |          \    |     /
      Alissa  Jayson  Sean            |           \   |    /
                                      |            \Sean_/
```


Even though something like that is technically possible, in practice we'll use
Github as a hub to sync between different repos.

The way I use it looks something like this:


      `Laptop <----------> Github <-----------> Repl.it`


Remote Control
--------------

When you have a remote repository that you want to send changes to, it is
sometimes refereed to as an **upstream repo** or just a **remote repository**.
For us, that will be the Github repo.

Git gives our first remote repository the default name of **origin**. A special
kind of branch is also created called a **tracking branch**. Its job is to
store a copy of the object database for the cooresponding branch from the
remote repo.

So it turns out, our repo actually looks more like this.

```
                          +------------------------+     +----------------------+
                          |    object-db           |     |  index               |
                          |  +-------------------+ |     +----------------------+

                          +------------------------+
```

Let's talk committment
----------------------

It's time to zoom in on commits. A **commit** is a set of changes recorded in
git. Sometimes also called a **revision** or a **change log**. Every commit has:

- a **SHA** or **hash** -- a 40-character unique identifier that points to a
  the rest of the data related to the commit. Basically, a commit ID. Here's an
  example: `d16085b3b913e5bc5e351c0a7461051e9973629a`

* a **patch** -- the file detailing the exact changes that were made in a format
  that git and other programs understand. It's very similar to the output of
  `git diff`.

* the **tree** -- a snapshot of your files at the time of the commit.

* Historical data detailing the ancestery of the commit.

* Metadata like the date, author, and commit message.


Altered States
--------------

Now that you are a little more familiar with the pieces and how they fit
togther, let's talk about what that means.

There are now potentially many different versions of your files that may exist
at any given time:

- your *working directory*
- the *index*
- *head*
    - `HEAD`, the ref
    - its *tree*
    - its *object-database*
      - for the *master* branch
      - for the *tracking branch* to remotes/origin/master
- *origin*
    - `HEAD`
    - its *tree*
    - its `object-database`
      - for the *master* branch


### Local States

Here are the possible states of local file changes.

```
  +------------------------------------------+----------------+-----------------------------------------+
  |  status                                  |  where         |  description                            |
  +------------------------------------------+----------------+-----------------------------------------+
  |  untracked   |                           |  working-tree  |  a new file                             |
  |  tracked     | modified                  |  working-tree  |  changes to a file                      |
  |  tracked     | staged                    |  index         |  changes queued up for the next commit  |
  |  tracked     | committed/unmodified      |  head          |  changes git has recorded               |
  +--------------+---------------------------+----------------+-----------------------------------------+
```

Note: It is possible for a file to be both `staged` AND `modified` at the same
time. This can happen if you stage a commit, then make additional changes to
the same file. It is actually the chunks of changes that are tracked, rather
than the file as a whole.


### Relative-to-Remote States

Here are the possible states of the local repository relative to the remote repository.

```
  +---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
  | status        | description                                                   |
  +---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
  | up to date    | local and remote are the same                                 |
  | behind        | remote changes not in local                                   |
  | ahead         | local changes not in remote                                   |
  | diverged      | local changes not in remote AND remote changes not in local   |
  +---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### State Changes

And finally, here is the workflow and how states change for each action.

```
  +--------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
  | working tree |   index      |              head                    |           origin            |
