    "Fundamentals: Expressions\n",
    "=========================\n",
    "\n",
    "An *expression* is a unit of code that can be solved to a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is called *evaluating* the expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the following simple expression that resolves to `30`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "10 * 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is comprised of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the *left-hand value* (*LHV*)\n",
    "* an *operator*\n",
    "* the *right-hand value* (*RHV*)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# LHV    Operator   RHV\n",
    "10       *          3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An *operator* is a symbol with special meaning that tells Python to do\n",
    "something. Some examples of operators include `+`, `=`, and `==`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an expression includes an operator involved in Python, there is always a\n",
    "*left-hand value* and a *right-hand value*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a more complicated example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "2 + 3 * 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we have 2 operators: `+` and `*`. So then which is the left-hand\n",
    "value, and which the right-hand?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that Python evaluates this the same way we would solve a math\n",
    "problem. That is, it breaks it down into multiple expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Expression 1: (3 * 6)\n",
    "#   LHV    Operator   RHV\n",
    "2 + 3      *           6\n",
    "\n",
    "# Expression 2: (2 + 18)\n",
    "# LHV    Operator   RHV\n",
    "2        +          18\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "3                        # a stand-alone vaue is the simplest expression\n",
    "\"hello\"                  # a stand-alone string value\n",
    "today = 16               # evaluates to 16\n",
    "today                    # a variable\n",
    "yesterday = today - 1    # two expressions: #1: today - 1, #2: yesterday = 15\n",
    "input()                  # functions with a return value also evaluate to a value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Anywhere that we can use a value, we can also use an expression. Python will\n",
    "first evaluate the expression, then use the resulting value in its place.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# using stand-alone values\n",
    "print(3)\n",
    "print(\"hello\")\n",
    "print(yesterday)\n",
    "\n",
    "# first, evaluates today-1\n",
    "# then sends 15 as an argument to print()\n",
    "print(today-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# first calls the input() function and waits for the user response\n",
    "# then sends the result to print()\n",
    "print(input())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-Quiz\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the operator in this expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"hello \" * 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the value of `name` is `\"Joe\"`, what is the argument that is sent to the `print()` function?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello \" + name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What does the following expression evaluate to?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "1 == 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "* **expression**: a unit of code that can be solved to a single value\n",
    "* **evaluate**: the process of solving an expression to its resulting value\n",
    "* **left-hand value**: the value to the left of an operator\n",
    "* **right-hand value**: the value to the right of an operator\n",
    "* **operator**: a symbol that has special meaning, telling Python to do something with the values on either side"
