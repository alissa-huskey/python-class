    "A {term}`statement` is an instruction that Python can run or {term}`execute` as\n",
    "a unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like grammar in prose, statements follow syntax rules telling Python where they\n",
    "begin and end as well as how they should be handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's syntax rules define statements as either a single logical line of\n",
    "code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "debug_mode = True\n",

    "Simple Statements\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "A {term}`simple statement` is a single instruction, one that does not group together\n",
    "other statements. In comprison to prose a simple statement is like a sentence.\n",
    "While there are exceptions, a simple statements is essentially a line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more accurate, a simple statement is a single instruction that could be\n",
    "written on one line by itself, even if it is actually written differently.\n",
    "This is referred to as a {term}`logical line`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single line statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time simple statements are written one per line. The newline\n",

    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "A {term}`compound statement` is a a number of statements grouped together as a\n",
