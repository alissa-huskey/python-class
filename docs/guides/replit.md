Recommended Settings
--------------------

On the left side, click the gear icon to change your settings.

These are the settings I recommend:

    indent type: spaces
    indent size: 4 spaces
    wrapping: none
    code intelligence: off


Creating New Scripts
--------------------

We'll be creating lots of scripts during our lessons.
Each script will be in a different file.

To create a new file:

1. Click the "Files" icon on the left side. (It looks like a page.)
   The "Files" pane will open with a list of your files.

2. At the top of the "Files" pane, click the "Add file" icon
   (It looks like a page with a green + sign.)

3. A new line will appear in your file list. Type a name for the file then hit enter.
   The name should have no spaces and end in ".py".
   For example "my_script.py" or "helloWorld.py".


Running New Scripts
------------------

After creating a new script, you will need to change what happens when you click "run >" at the top of the page.

1. Click the "Files" icon on the left side. (It looks like a page.)
   The "Files" pane will open with a list of your files.

2. Click on the file named ".replit" to edit it.
   (Or if it does not exist, create it using the instructions above.)

3. Add the line:

*.replit*
```
run = "python3 <filename>"
```

  But replace "\<filename\>" with the name of the file you created.
