# When you create a variable, it is like collecting inventory.

# Variables have an *identifer* and a *value*. The identifer is the name, and
# the value is the data that is holds.

# To create a variable, you *assign* it, using the `=` operator.
#
# <identifier> = <value>

    "silver",
    "gold",
