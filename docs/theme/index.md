Kitchen Sink
============



```{note}

   The Kitchen Sink was generated from the `Sphinx Themes website <https://sphinx-themes.org/>`_, a community-supported showcase of themes for `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_.
   Check it out to see other great themes.

      Go to Sphinx Themes
```

This section exists as a dump of all the things that Sphinx has.

It has exactly one goal: to be a good checklist of things to stylise within Sphinx. This also means that it is a complete showcase of *everything* that vanilla Sphinx provides and includes all sorts of edge cases.
