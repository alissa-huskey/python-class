Kitchen Sink
============



```{note}

   The Kitchen Sink was originally generated from the [Sphinx Themes
   website](https://sphinx-themes.org/), a community-supported showcase of
   themes for [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org). Check it out to see other great themes.

   It has since been modified for Python Class.

```

This section exists as a dump of all the things that Sphinx has.

It has exactly one goal: to be a good checklist of things to stylise within Sphinx. This also means that it is a complete showcase of *everything* that vanilla Sphinx provides and includes all sorts of edge cases.
