Part x: Good tests
------------------

* Fast --
* Complete -- The whole codebase should be tested and all possible cases.
* Resiliant -- won't break if your code changes in trivial ways. Don't wrongly
  fail or pass. Don't fail intermittently.
* Maintainable -- It should be easy to add new tests or make changes to your
  tests when your code changes.
* Isolated -- They set themselves up, and clean up after themselves.
  Tests need to set themselves up so that you can run tests individually. When
  working on a portion of code, you donâ€™t want to have to waste time running
  the entire suite just to see output from a single test
* Expressive -- It should be easy to tell what is being tested. Testing is
  documentation.

### Glossary

```{glossary} writing-tests

BDD
Behavior-driven development
  A testing practice that follows the idea of specification by example. The
  idea is to describe how the application should behave in a very simple
  user/business-focused language.

GWT
Given-When-Then
  A formula from BDD for structuring test scenarios which is oriented from the
  user perspective and is comprised of ordered "given", "when", or "then"
  steps.
