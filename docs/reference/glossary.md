```{glossary} programming-concepts

escaping
  How to indicate to the computer that an operator inside of a string should
  not be interpreted but instead be treated be treated as part of the string.
  For example, you would need to escape a single-quote in a string surrounded
  by single-quotes, a double-quote in a string surrounded by double-quotes, and
  the escape character in any string. In Python (and many other languages) the
  escape character is a backslash (`\`).

immutable
  A value that cannot be changed. In Python these include numbers, strings and
  tuples.

iterate
iteration
iterating
  To repeat over a unit of code, usually within a loop. Each repetition is
  called an *iteration*.

key
  A value used to retrieve another value from a {term}`dictionary`.

mutable
  A value that can be changed.

string concatenation
concatenation
concatenate
  Joining two or more strings together.

loop
  A block of code that will repeat until a specified condition is reached. For
  example *for-loops* and *while-loops*. An *infinite-loop* occurs if there is
  no condition or the condition can never be met.

```{glossary} data-types
boolean
bool
  True or False values.

dictionary
dict
  A collection of key-value pairs.

floating-point number
float
  Fractions or numbers with decimal points.

integer
int
  Whole numbers values.

list
  A collection of values. In Python lists are mutable and they are defined by
  surrounding the comma-separated values with square-bracket (`[]`).

string
str
  Text values. They are surrounded by single or double quotes. In Python, there
  is no difference between using single or double quotes, except which
  characters you have to escape.

none
null
  A special value that indicates nothingness which is different from the value
  zero or an empty string. In Python it is referred to as None without quotes.
  In other languages: null, nil.

```{glossary} software-development
code editor
  A text editing program specifically for code with features like syntax
  highlighting and code formatting. Some examples include VS Code, Atom,
  Sublime, Textmate and Vim.

compile
  The process by which the computer translates source code from one programming
  language to a lower-level language to create an executable program. A
  language that must be compiled is called a compiled language and the
  program that does this for a particular programming language is called a
  compiler. Python is an interpreted language, so it does not need to be
  compiled. Some compiled languages include C/C++, Java and Go.

integrated development environment
IDE
  A program dedicated to software development usually including a code editor,
  debugger, version control management, and build/execution features. Examples
  include repl.it, Eclipse, Thonny, and Pycharm.

interpret
  The process by which the computer directly executes source code without that
  code needing to be compiled first. The program that does this for a
  particular programming language is called an interpreter. A programming
  language that does not need to be compiled is called an interpreted
  language or sometimes a scripting language. Python is an interpreted
  language and Python code is executed by the Python Interpreter.  Some other
  interpreted languages include Ruby, PHP and Perl.
